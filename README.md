# Netflix-EDA-Project

# Netflix Content Analysis  
This project explores the Netflix dataset to analyze trends and patterns in its catalog of movies and TV shows. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we uncover insights into genres, release years, ratings, and content distribution across countries.  

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to answer key questions about Netflix's content library, such as:  
- How has Netflix's content evolved over the years?  
- What are the most popular genres?  
- Which countries contribute the most content?  
- What is the ratio of movies to TV shows?  
- How do ratings vary across different content?  

## Dataset  
The dataset used is **[Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)**, which contains information about titles available on Netflix, including genre, country, director, cast, release year, and ratings.  

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations  

## Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Handle missing values in columns such as `director`, `cast`, and `country`.  
   - Convert `date_added` to datetime format.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze the proportion of movies vs. TV shows.  
   - Study trends in content release over the years.  
   - Explore top genres and countries producing content.  
   - Examine ratings distribution.  

3. **Visualization**:  
   - Create bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to visualize insights.  

## Key Insights  
- Netflix's content library has grown significantly over the years, with a notable increase in TV shows.  
- Drama and Comedy are the most popular genres.  
- The United States produces the highest number of titles.
